            ### Community Summary
            
            **Modularity Q Score**  
            A measure of how well a network is partitioned into communities. 
            Value close to 1: indicates strong community structure.
            Value close to 0: indicates weak community structure.
            
            **Within Ratio**  
            A measure of how internally connected the communities are, as oposed to connections outside of the community.
            High within ratio: Community mostly communicates within the community.
            Low within ratio: Community interacts heavily with other communities.
            
            ### Clustering Methods
            
            **Girvan-Newman**  
            Detects communities by repeatedly removing edges with high betweenness centrality, which act as bridges between groups. 
            As these bridging edges are removed, the network splits into increasingly well-defined communities. 
            The amount of communities to be distinct can be adjusted.
            
            **Spectral**  
            Identifies communities by using the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian to partition the network into weakly connected groups. 
            It is based on minimizing a graph-cut objective and is effective at revealing global structure in the network. 
            The amount of communities to be distinct can be adjusted.
            
            **Louvain**  
            Detects communities by iteratively grouping nodes to maximize the modularity Q score. 
            It is well suited for large networks and produces a hierarchical community structure.
            Because the Louvain method maximizes modularity it can not be used to set a number for the amount of communities you want to distinct. 
            Therefore it may make a distinction between more than two communities.

            ### Robustness Analysis
            
            Robustness analysis evaluates how stable the results of a network analysis are when the network is slightly altered or when different methods are applied. 
            A robust result indicates that the identified structure reflects meaningful patterns rather than noise or modeling choices.
            
            **Perturbation Test**  
            Assesses robustness by deliberately introducing small changes to the network, in this case removing some of the edges, and re-running the analysis. 
            If the results remain largely unchanged, the detected structure is considered robust.
            
            **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)**  
            Measures the similarity between two clusterings while correcting for simularities that could occur by chance. 
            In this context, it is used to quantify how consistently communities are identified under network perturbations. 
            ARI close to 1 = Robust method of community clustering.
            ARI close to 0 = Community completely changes when perturbation test is applied
