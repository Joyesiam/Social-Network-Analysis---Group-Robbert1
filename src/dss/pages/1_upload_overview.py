"""Streamlit page: Upload & Overview.

This page allows the user to upload a `.mtx` file, validates it and
computes basic statistics.  It also displays a baseline network plot
with no particular sizing or colouring.  Once the graph is loaded,
subsequent pages can access it via `st.session_state`.

                ### Welcome
                
                This dashboard allows you to analyze network structures using advanced graph-based methods.  
                Everything starts by uploading a network file.
                
                ---
                
                ### What to upload
                
                Upload a **Matrix Market (.mtx)** file that represents a network adjacency matrix.
                
                - Each row and column corresponds to a node  
                - Non-zero values indicate connections between nodes  
                
                ---
                
                ### What happens next
                
                After uploading the file:
                
                - The network is automatically loaded and validated  
                - All analysis pages in the navigation menu become available  
                - Centrality, roles, communities, robustness, and optimization analyses can be performed  
                
                ---
                
                ### No file uploaded yet
                
                If no file is uploaded, the analysis pages remain inactive.  
                Once a valid `.mtx` file is provided, you can immediately continue with the next steps.
                
                ---
                ### Tip
                
                If you are unsure about the file format or interpretation of results, consult the **User Manual** in the navigation menu for detailed explanations and examples.
