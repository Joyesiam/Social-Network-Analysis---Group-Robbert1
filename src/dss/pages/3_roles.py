                **Cooper and Barahona** \\
                computes a similarity matrix by comparing nodes'
                flow profiles, which are paths of various lengths from one node
                to another, where these flow profiles can be created using either k-hop
                or random walk signatures. For the comparison, we provide both cosine and
                correlation distance functions. After computing the similarity matrix,
                we can cluster the nodes and assign nodes their respective roles
                through this clustering.

                
                **RoleSim** \\
                computes a similarity matrix through a iterative procedure, where
                it uses information on the a specific set of neighbours in the neighbourhoods 
                for each node combination, even if nodes are not connected in the network itself.
                After obtaining the similarity matrix, clustering is performed to assign roles. 
                Pre-specified value for the decay factor can be adjusted to fit the user's needs.

                **RoleSim*** \\
                takes a similar approach as RoleSim, with the difference being that 
                RoleSim* uses information of the entire neighbourhood of the nodes that are being compared.
                Again, after construction of the similarity matrix, through the iterative RoleSim* 
                procedure, clustering is performed to assign roles.
                Pre-specified value for the decay factor and weight balancing factor can be adjusted to 
                fit the user's needs.

                **RolX** \\
                takes a different approach to the other methods, as no similarity
                matrix is constructed in this instance. Instead, it creates a feature vector,
                which in our case includes a number of centrality measures, as well as some other information
                regarding the network. Then this feature vector is used in the RolX procedure to
                group nodes together, and assign roles to each of these groups.
