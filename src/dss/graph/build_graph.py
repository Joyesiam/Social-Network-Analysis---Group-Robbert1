#     """Construct a NetworkX graph from a sparse adjacency matrix.

#     Parameters
#     ----------
#     adjacency: csr_matrix
#         A square sparse matrix representing the adjacency weights between
#         nodes.  Non‑zero entries indicate edges; diagonal entries are
#         ignored.
#     directed: bool, optional
#         Whether to build a directed graph.  If False (default), an
#         undirected graph is built.  Otherwise, a :class:`networkx.DiGraph` is returned.

#     Returns
#     -------
#     networkx.Graph
#         The resulting graph.  Self loops are removed automatically.

#     Notes
#     -----
#     Recent versions of NetworkX (3.0 and above) have deprecated
#     ``from_scipy_sparse_matrix`` in favour of ``from_scipy_sparse_array``.
#     To maintain compatibility across versions, this function manually
#     constructs the graph by iterating over the non‑zero entries of the
#     adjacency matrix.  This avoids reliance on deprecated API and
#     eliminates the need for SciPy sparse array conversion.
